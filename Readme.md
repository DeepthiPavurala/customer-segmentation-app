# 🧠 Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis and Flask Web App

This project performs customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering. It includes both model development in a Jupyter notebook and a production-ready Flask web application to upload CSVs, predict clusters, and visualize customer behavior.

## 🔍 Overview

This project clusters bank customers into meaningful groups using unsupervised learning based on their transaction behavior. It combines:

- 📊 **RFM feature engineering**: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value
- 🤖 **KMeans clustering**: Groups customers into segments
- 🌐 **Flask web app**: Upload CSVs → Predict clusters → Visualize plots → Download results

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.9
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Flask

---

## 📈 Model Building (`cust_segmentation.ipynb`)

- Reads transaction data
- Calculates RFM features per customer
- Scales features using `StandardScaler`
- Applies `KMeans` clustering
- Saves both the model and scaler together using `pickle`

> Output: `KMeans_model.pkl` (model + scaler)

---

## 🚀 Web App (`app.py`)

### Features:
- Upload `.csv` cleaned file of transaction data
- Automatically computes RFM features
- Loads pre-trained KMeans model + scaler
- Predicts customer clusters
- Saves result CSV and generates:
  - 📦 `Frequency by Cluster`
  - 📦 `Recency by Cluster`
  - 📦 `Monetary by Cluster` box plots
